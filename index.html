        <header>What is HTML</header>
        <p>HTML & CSS are the programming languages that tell a web browser how it should display the visual elements of a web page. While basic, they are some of the world's most commonly used programming languages. All modern web pages are built off of a base of HTML & CSS, so anyone looking to develop web applications will need to learn these languages. In this overview, you’ll learn more about what HTML & CSS is, what they can do, who uses them, and how to understand them to add this skill to your professional toolbox.</p>

        <header>What you can do with HTML and CSS</header>
        <p>Using HTML & CSS, you can design rudimentary web pages and begin the process of learning how to create dynamic and evocative web pages. While most modern web page design programs like WordPress allow novice users to construct more elaborate web pages than with HTML & CSS training alone, learning how to work with HTML & CSS prepares students for complex coding processes using programming languages such as JavaScript, React, or Python.

        <p>HTML and CSS are open source and thus free to anyone. There is no cost to building a web page using these two programming languages. Since they are both simple and essential languages, a great deal of energy has gone into compiling code libraries that new programmers can draw off. These libraries will include snippets of code to define colors, backgrounds, fonts, paragraph breaks, and other essential visual display elements. </p>

        <header>Benefits of Learning HTML and CSS</header>
        <p>If your goal is to build web pages, personally or professionally, you’ll need to learn how to use HTML & CSS. While almost all modern web pages use more complex programming languages, such as JavaScript or Python, HTML & CSS are the backbones of the modern website. These are the languages that tell a browser how to distinguish elements of a web page for display, meaning that these are the languages that make more internet browsing possible. Web Developers cannot construct the architecture onto which they build more complex digital elements for web pages without knowing how to use these two languages.

        <p>This largely depends on an individual decision. It is possible to learn online through websites that are free such as <a href="freeCodeCamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a> or in a universty as Computer Science alongside other programming languages</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="History_of_HTML_and_CSS">
        <header>History of HTML and CSS</header>
        <p>HTML was first developed in the late-1980s as part of an internal system that would allow CERN scientists to share documents. The language was initially released to the public in 1993 by the Internet Explorer Task Force, which sought to standardize HTML specifications and define the language’s grammar. Despite going through several changes and updates, HTML 2.0 was released in 1995 and quickly became the standard language in which modern web pages are written. In its 5th significant iteration, HTML remains one of the most essential parts of internet infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>CSS was developed in 1996 to separate visual presentation information from HTML, as the growing number of different web browser options made uniform styling of web pages more difficult. CSS was an attempt to solve this problem by creating a unified style sheet that would ‘cascade’ by hierarchizing various formatting rules if multiple rules were applied at once. This would give web pages a more uniform appearance across different browsers. While its adoption took time, CSS has become the standard language for defining visual styles on the World Wide Web.

      <section class="main-section" id="Summary">
        <header>Summary</header>
        <p>HTML & CSS are the two programming languages that tell a web browser how it should display elements of a web page. HTML defines the difference between web elements, such as what is text and what is a title, and CSS tells the web browser how to style those elements visually, such as telling it what font and size to print the text you are reading. HTML & CSS are the backbones of modern web page development. While they are limited in their functionality, web pages, as we understand them, would look very different without HTML & CSS. HTML & CSS are both open-source and have an extensive library of free resources to help new coders develop web pages. Users may need to pay to edit applications or host their web pages. The development of HTML & CSS dates back to the early 1990s, and the standardization of both languages coincided with the development of the public internet.</p>
